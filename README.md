I am a recent Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate with the Highest Honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology, with a concentration in Economic and Financial Systems. 
I am a fluent English and Spanish speaker, having citizenship in the US and Mexico.

I am looking for a full-time position or internship to start to grow as a professional engineer and apply the knowledge obtained through college and past experience. 
As an Industrial Engineer, I have learned multiple problem-solving skills that can be applied in the real world, helping people by analyzing data and improving processes.

Throughout these years, I had the opportunity to apply several industrial & systems engineering concepts to real-life problems. 
From sports analyses to optimization and designing new systems, I have had multiple experiences that prepared me for the environment outside of class. 
I am a hard-working person looking to help people with their problems, and I am always open to hearing other ideas and learning from others.
